# üìù Overview

**$OTCL** is a high-frequency trading (HFT) OTC limit order execution protocol on Solana. It enables institutional and large-scale traders to place limit orders off-chain or on-chain while ensuring price stability and minimal market impact.

**NOTE CURRENT VERSION IS ONLY DEVELOPED IN SOLANA PLAYGROUND AND NEXT VERSION WILL BE EXPORTED TO VSCODE**

## üîπ How It Works:

- Traders lock collateral in **$OTCL tokens** to create large-limit OTC orders.
- Liquidity providers (market makers) fulfill orders and earn **$OTCL token rewards**.
- **Priority staking** boosts order execution speed & reduces fees.
- **Multisig approval** allows institutional & DAO traders to authorize orders.
- **Commit-Reveal anti-frontrunning** prevents MEV exploits.
- **Fee rebates & governance vault** accumulate treasury funds.
